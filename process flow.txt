### 1. Map and GUI Setup
- **Mapping Library:** Use Leaflet.js or Mapbox GL JS to display a map with HUC12, HUC8, and HUC4 layers.
- **User Interface:** Add controls for uploading shapefiles and toggling visibility of different hydrological units.

### 2. Shapefile Upload and Data Extraction
- **Upload Interface:** Provide an upload button for shapefiles, ensuring support for related files (.shp, .shx, .dbf).
- **Data Handling:** Upon upload, parse the shapefile using backend services to extract streamflow data and AOI (Area of Interest) boundaries. Use a library like `pyshp` (for Python) or `shapefile` (JavaScript) to parse the data, focusing on attributes related to streamflow.

### 3. Automatic Analysis and Model Integration
- **Data Storage:** Store the extracted data in a spatial database (e.g., PostGIS) for efficient querying and analysis.
- **Flow Analysis with HEC-RAS:** Utilise Jython to bridge between Python-based processing and HEC-RAS, a widely used hydrological model. Set up scripts to run HEC-RAS simulations, checking the flow figures based on the real-world streamflow data.
- **Synthetic Storm Simulation:** After verifying the streamflow data, add a synthetic storm to simulate potential flood events. The simulation parameters (e.g., storm intensity, duration) should be configurable and based on standard hydrological practices or user input.
- **Jython and HEC-RAS Integration:** Use Jython to script the interaction with HEC-RAS, enabling automated data processing and simulation runs. Handle data conversion and format requirements between the shapefile data and HEC-RAS input files.

### 4. Result Visualisation and User Interaction
- **Display Results:** Visualise the simulation results on the map, highlighting areas affected by the synthetic storm and potential flood risks. Use interactive elements (e.g., pop-ups, overlays) to show detailed data for specific areas or streams.
- **Download and Reporting:** Provide options for users to download the simulation results, including detailed reports or raw data files.

### 5. Gathering and Preparing Data
- **Flood Maps:** Collect flood maps from the 2019 event, ensuring they are georeferenced and available in a compatible format (e.g., GeoTIFF, shapefiles).
- **FEMA Insurance Data:** Obtain FEMA insurance data, which includes information on claims, payouts, and affected areas. This data should include county-level identifiers.

### 6. Data Extraction and Matching
- **Extract County Information from FEMA Data:** Parse the FEMA insurance data to extract relevant fields, particularly those identifying the counties (e.g., county codes, names).
- **Overlaying Flood Maps with County Boundaries:** Use GIS software or spatial data processing tools to overlay the 2019 flood maps with county boundaries. This involves:
  - Loading both datasets into a GIS environment.
  - Ensuring both datasets use the same coordinate system for accurate overlay.
  - Intersecting the flood map areas with county boundaries to identify affected counties.
- **Matching Insurance Data to Flooded Counties:** Join the FEMA insurance data with the intersected flood map data using the county identifiers. This step involves matching the county codes/names in the insurance data with those derived from the flood map overlay.

### 7. Visualisation and Analysis
- **Mapping Affected Areas:** Create maps showing the extent of flooding within each county, highlighting areas with significant insurance claims or payouts. Use different visual elements (e.g., colours, shading) to represent the severity of flooding and the number of claims.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyse the matched data to understand the correlation between flood extent and insurance claims. Identify patterns or areas with disproportionately high or low insurance coverage relative to the flood impact.

### 8. Reporting and Output
- **Reporting:** Generate reports that summarise the findings, including maps, tables, and narrative explanations. Reports should include data on the number of claims, total payouts, and the areas most affected.
- **Output Options:** Provide options for exporting the maps and data in various formats (e.g., PDF, CSV, shapefiles) for further analysis or presentation.

### 9. Identification of Suitable Areas for Flood Alleviation and Restoration
- **Hydrological Analysis:** Identify areas with high runoff and rapid flow rates, and assess the current water retention capacity.
- **Soil and Land Use Assessment:** Analyse soil porosity and permeability, and evaluate current land use practices.
- **Ecological and Vegetative Analysis:** Identify regions with sparse vegetation or degraded lands and assess the suitability for reforestation.
- **Topographical Analysis:** Focus on slope and elevation to identify potential areas for creating retention features.
- **Biodiversity and Conservation Considerations:** Prioritise areas important for biodiversity conservation and consider existing protected areas.
- **Community and Socioeconomic Factors:** Engage with local communities and evaluate potential socioeconomic benefits.
- **Geospatial and Remote Sensing Tools:** Use GIS and remote sensing to overlay data layers and monitor land use changes.
- **Climate and Meteorological Data:** Analyse precipitation patterns and consider climate change projections.

### 10. Notification and Workflow Management
- **User Feedback:** Implement a notification system to inform users of analysis progress and completion, either through the UI or via email.
- **Reporting and Documentation:** Generate automated reports summarising the analysis and simulation results, which can be exported in formats like PDF.
